Make a toybox for your kitty. Because they deserve it. It's really easy.

**What you'll need**

- Shoebox or shallow cardboard box
- Toilet paper tubes and/or paper towel tubes
- Paper egg carton 
- Scissors
- Hot glue gun
- Cat treats, catnip and/or small cat toys

**Instruction**
1. Remove the lids/flaps on the boxes, same with egg carton. Cut the rest into thirds with your scissors.

2. Trim the cardboard tubes until they are each as long as the box is deep.

3. Stand the tubes up in the box along with the egg carton segments and arrange them to your liking. Hot glue each piece to the floor of the box, making sure the edges of the tubes are sufficiently fastened on the bottom.

4. Put cat toys/treats into the box, spreading them evenly between the tubes and cartons.

5. Put the toybox on the floor and let your kitty have fun!
