So you bought a cat and they are tearing up your furniture, you clothes, your plants and anything else they can get their claws on. Although cats scratching is a normal behaviour that you can't prevent, it's still your fault. Why is that? Here are a few reasons out of many reasons here: 


## Don't have the right outlet.

 As mentioned above cats are going to scratch, it's in their nature for many reasons.For example they scratch to remove the dead outer layers on their claws. So why is it still your fault when your cat is scratching everything? Because you can redirect their need to scratch on the appropriate surfaces.

**How to fix it**

One solution is to provide objects for scratching that are appealing, and convenient from your catâ€™s point of view. Observe the physical features of the objects your cat is scratching. Here are some things to consider:
1. The height of the object.
2. What is the texture like?
3. The location of the object.
4. the shape of object.

From there you can implement the appropriate objects for your cat to scratch. There should scratch less of your belongings. If not, well I don't know, google it.


## You have bored kitty.

Sometimes your cat is bored, so bored that they need something to do, hence why they will scratch everything.Also, it can be attention seeking, especially if you give them more attention when they do scratch. Shame on you. Why is your cat bored in the first place? They deserved to be entertained 24/7 when they demand it. 

**How to fix it**

One solution is to play with your cat, it helps reduce the boredom they feel.Also, they will be too tired to scratch everything in their wake.
