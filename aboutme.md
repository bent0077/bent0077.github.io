My name is Sashea. I like everything about cats and I have the following qualities:

- I'm a great cook.
- I can spin around really fast without getting sick.
- Sometimes I'm nice.
- Personal interest in cats/ cat related stuff.


I know very little about cats but I still think they are cool.

### My story

Since I was a kid, I've always wanted a cat. Sadly, my dad doesn't like them so I still don't have a cat. It makes me very sad. That is my villain origin story.
